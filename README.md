# Minor-project
Minor project using python - random password generator
Project Title: Mention the project title, such as "Password Generator in Python."

Objective: Briefly describe the goal of your project, which is to generate strong and random passwords.

Skills Used:

Mention the programming languages and libraries you used (e.g., Python, random module).
Highlight any relevant technical skills like data manipulation and string handling.
Password Strength: Discuss how your password generator ensures password strength by including a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.

Randomness: Explain how your generator uses randomness to create unique passwords with each run.

User Interaction:

Code Structure:
Describe any user interaction components, such as command-line prompts.
Mention if you created a user-friendly interface.

Testing and Validation:
Mention that you organized your code into functions for readability and reusability.
Emphasize the use of modular code and clean code practices.


Security Considerations:
Explain how you tested the generated passwords to ensure they meet security standards.
Describe any validation rules you implemented to prevent the generation of weak passwords.


Customization:
Discuss any measures you took to protect the generated passwords, such as not storing them and ensuring they are generated locally.


Documentation:
Mention if your generator allows users to customize password length or other characteristics.


Version Control:
Highlight the importance of clear and concise code comments and documentation to make your code accessible to others.


Challenges:
If applicable, mention your use of version control systems like Git to track changes and collaborate with others.

Future Improvement:
Discuss any challenges you encountered during the project and how you overcame them.

Learning Experience:
Discuss what you learned from the project, both in terms of technical skills and problem-solving abilities.
